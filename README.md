This repo contains the solution to the assignment. All necessary python dependencies are in requirements.txt file.
Running the notebook file (main_notebook.ipynb) is simpler and more suitable for visualisation.
However, since in the assignment description is was requested to write a Python script, a script version (main.py) is also uploaded.
